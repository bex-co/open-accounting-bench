# Accounting policy (applies to this task)

- Reporting currency: USD. Reporting period: January 2026.
- Append-only ledger: never edit or delete existing transactions in
  `/app/ledger.beancount`. Record new or correcting entries as new
  transactions so the audit trail is preserved.
- Use only accounts listed in `/app/chart_of_accounts.md`. Do not open
  new accounts.
- Consumable supplies and services consumed in the period are expenses.
  Only items with a useful life over one year are capitalized as assets.
- Every transaction must balance (debits equal credits) and be dated
  within the reporting period unless the task states otherwise.
- Treasury stock is accounted for by the cost method: the full
  repurchase price is debited to `Equity:TreasuryStock` (a
  contra-equity account, not an asset). Common stock and APIC are
  unchanged until the shares are reissued or retired.
